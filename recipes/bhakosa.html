        <h1> Process of making dough for Bhakosa
        </h1>

        <p>Put 1 cup (150 grams) of wheat flour, ½ cup of semolina, ½ tsp of salt and 1 tsp of ghee (oil can also be
            used instead of ghee) in a bowl. Mix them well and knead a soft dough by adding little by little water.
            After kneading the dough, keep it covered for 20 minutes.
        </p>

        <h1> Process of making stuffing for Bhakosa
        </h1>

        <p>Wash and soak ½ cup of chana dal and 2 tbsp of urad dal for 2 hours. When the time is up, put soaked chana
            dal, soaked urad dal, 2-3 green chilies and ½ inch of ginger in a mixer jar and grind it lightly. While
            grinding the lentils, stir the mixer intermittently, stop stirring once, twirl the dal with a little spoon
            and then stir again. By this the dal will grind well.
        </p>

        <p>Grind them and take them out in a bowl. Now add ¼ cup of peas, ¼ cup of finely chopped capsicum, ¼ cup of
            finely chopped french beans, ¾ tsp of salt, ½ tsp of crushed red chilli, ½ tsp of turmeric powder, 1 tsp of
            coriander powder, ½ tsp of amchur powder, ¼ tsp of garam masala, 1 pinch of asafoetida and 2-3 tbsp of green
            coriander. Mix this mixture well, stuffing will be ready.
        </p>

        <h1> Process of filling Bhakosa
        </h1>

        <p>Take a little ghee in your hand and mash the dough well. Now cover water in a pan and let it heat up. Now
            break small balls of dough. Take one ball, remember that in the meantime keep the rest of the dough covered,
            otherwise the dough will dry out. Make a round dough like a peda and roll out the size of the poori,
            remember to roll it as thick as a paratha.
        </p>


        <p>Now keep the bottom side up and keep about 1-1.5 spoons of stuffing in the middle, fold it like a gujiya,
            close it and stick it on its side. Similarly prepare all the bhakose by filling them.
        </p>

        <h1> Process of boiling Bhakosa
        </h1>

        <p>Put these bhakos in the pan which was kept for boiling water, as many as can be put in the pan. Then cover
            the pan and cook the bhakosa for 4-5 minutes. When they float up, turn them one by one and cover the pan
            from the back. Remember, the flame will remain strong all the time and the water should also be kept
            boiling, the pan should not be covered completely, it has to be kept slightly open. After cooking them like
            this for 15 minutes, take them out in a sieve, drain them and cool them. Similarly boil the rest of the
            bhakose.
        </p>

        <h1> Process of frying Bhakosa
        </h1>

        <p>Now cut into two or three pieces the fritters which were kept on the sieve to cool down. Cool the rest and
            cut them in the same way. Now put 2 tsp of ghee in a pan and heat it. Put ½ tsp of mustard seeds in hot ghee
            and let them crackle a bit. After this, add ½ tsp of cumin and 15-20 curry leaves and fry the spices on a
            very low flame.
        </p>


        <p>Now add chopped bhakose, 2 pinch salt and ½ tsp of crushed red chili and fry them while stirring them
            lightly. Fry them while stirring them in a while till the coating of spices comes on them, meanwhile the
            flame will also remain medium. When they are fried well, take them out, in this way the bhakos will be
            ready. Serve them with green chutney, tomato sauce and mayonnaise and enjoy their taste.
        </p>


        <h1> Suggestions </h1>
        <p>The bhakosa has to be rolled as thick as the whole paratha.
        </p>
        <p>To boil the bhakosa, the water should be boiling all the time.
        </p>

        <h1>ENJOY!</h1>
